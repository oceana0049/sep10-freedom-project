### Changes I have made to my content.

The changed I have made to my content.md were to make it fit better into my freedom project website. I organized the technology in health and fitness by how complex and advanced they are.
The least complex ones were [my fitness pal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), a nutrition tracking app. [map my run](https://www.mapmyrun.com), a distance and speed tracking app for cardio. And my invention RemoteRace, a running app that uses GPS to race people online in real time. The moderately complex ones were [fitbod](https://fitbod.me/), a strength training app that uses AI to plan workouts. [fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com), a watch that can track heart rate, sleep, calories burnt, and others. The most complex ones were home workout machinery. Such as [peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com), a company that produces a lineup of advanced cardio equipment. Such as bikes, treadmills, rowers, etc. [tonal](https://tonal.com), a cable home workout system in which you can vary up workouts with different attachments and equipment, as well as a progress tracking system. and my invention, the Smartbell. A dumbbell thhat can be adjusted for weight, direction of resistance, shape of dumbbell, etc. 

### Engineering design process.

I am currently on step 3 of the engineering design process, brainstorming. I am creating new Ideas about inventions in the technology of health nd fitness.

### Skills

A new skill I have picked up is **creativity**. This project of creating new inventions has sparked my imagination. Some of the inventions I have made may not be possible with today's technology, but technology is constantly evolving.

Another skill I have gained more of is **perseverence**. This unit contained a lot of hard work. It was easy to slack off and forget about everything, but I am glad I got back on task.

## Conclusion

I made changes to my content.md to make it more organized, as well as creating new ideas for technology in health/fitness.
