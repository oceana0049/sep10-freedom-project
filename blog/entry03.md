### Changes I have made to my content.

The changed I have made to my content.md were to make it fit better into my freedom project website. I organized the technology in health and fitness by how complex and advanced they are.
The least complex ones were [my fitness pal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), a nutrition tracking app. [map my run](https://www.mapmyrun.com), a distance and speed tracking app for cardio. And my invention RemoteRace, a running app that uses GPS to race people online in real time. The moderately complex ones were [fitbod](https://fitbod.me/), a strength training app that uses AI to plan workouts. [fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com), a watch that can track heart rate, sleep, calories burnt, and others. The most complex ones were home workout machinery. Such as [peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com), a company that produces a lineup of advanced cardio equipment. Such as bikes, treadmills, rowers, etc. [tonal](https://tonal.com), a cable home workout system in which you can vary up workouts with different attachments and equipment, as well as a progress tracking system. and my invention, the Smartbell. A dumbbell thhat can be adjusted for weight, direction of resistance, shape of dumbbell, etc.
