### Why health and fitness?

I chose health and fitness because it's a topic i've recently become passionste about. One of my good friends that i've known for a long time got me into it. I remember a few years back, we were at a restaurant. I asked him why he didnt get any soda, he said "It has too many added sugars." I was a bit confused. I even laughed at him at first for taking something so petty into consideration. Back then, I was a big junk food eater. I was physically active, engaging in sports like karate and soccer frequently. But, I ate lots of unhealthy foods, especially tortilla chips, and fast food burgers. Around 1 year ago, my passion for karate was starting to fade. Balancing the hard, draining cardio workouts and the complex forms I had to remember with high school was a big pain, and it stressed me out. My friend told me I should start lifting weights. I soon found a passion for it, and me and him would talk about it every night. A few months later, i changed my diet. I incorporated more protein, fruits, vegetables, and less processed foods. I have researched this topic extensively, and it is a very large interest at the moment. Here are some articles that have shown the link between technology, and health topics.

### Engineering Design Process

I am on step 1 of the engineering design process, defining. I think the average american eats a lot of processed food, and lives a sedentary lifestyle. I am grateful for technology to be a great way for information to get to people, but it is also a place for sketchy advertisements and trickery. I am excited to use technology to learn, and share information about health and fitness.
