### Why health and fitness?

I chose health and fitness because it's a topic i've recently become passionste about. One of my good friends that i've known for a long time got me into it. I remember a few years back, we were at a restaurant. I asked him why he didnt get any soda, he said "It has too many added sugars." I was a bit confused. I even laughed at him at first for taking something so petty into consideration. Back then, I was a big junk food eater. I was physically active, engaging in sports like karate and soccer frequently. But, I ate lots of unhealthy foods, especially tortilla chips, and fast food burgers. Around 1 year ago, my passion for karate was starting to fade. Balancing the hard, draining cardio workouts and the complex forms I had to remember with high school was a big pain, and it stressed me out. My friend told me I should start lifting weights. I soon found a passion for it, and me and him would talk about it every night. A few months later, i changed my diet. I incorporated more protein, fruits, vegetables, and less processed foods. I have researched this topic extensively, and it is a very large interest at the moment. Here are some articles that have shown the link between technology, and health topics.

### Engineering Design Process

I am on step 1 of the engineering design process, defining. I think the average american eats a lot of processed food, and lives a sedentary lifestyle. I am grateful for technology to be a great way for information to get to people, but it is also a place for sketchy advertisements and trickery. I am excited to use technology to learn, and share information about health and fitness.

### Skills

One skill i have gained is **researching skills.** finding sources for information from different websites has been quite useful to me, especially for this project and projects before. Knowing how to research on google makes it easier to have information when you need it, and save time.

Another skill that I have learned is **notetaking skills.** Knowing how to take notes on things like Markdown and HTML, without being advised to directly has helped me remember more information about coding, even when things are quite complicated. I also dont have to search everywhere for coding info when they are in my notes. For example, I took a lot of notes for HTML, which helped me on the "create something" homework.

### Summary
I cant wait to learn more about health and fitness, as well as how technology plays a role!
