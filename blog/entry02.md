### Context, research I have done so far

So far, I have looked at the software and hardware for health and fitness. The spftware that I have found has mostly been apps.
These apps help you acheive health and fitness goals. The first app I looked at was [my fitness pal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/). This app is mostly a nutrition/calorie tracking app. The premium version can create meal plans for you. I also looked at movement tracking apps like [map my run](https://www.mapmyrun.com), and workout apps that use AI like [fitbod](https://fitbod.me/). For hardware, there were a few gadgets and smart workout systems I looked at. The [tonal](https://tonal.com) is a woorkout machine that attches to a wall. It uses a system that tracks your workouts automatically and adjusts the weight accordingly. Everybody knows about [peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com). A smart stationary bike, and other cardio equipment with a place to watch workout videos. As well as [fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com), a watch that can track your heart rate, your sleep, etc. At first, I thought there were no hardware for health and fitness, until I realized that hardware is a broad term, and started searching.

### Engineering design process.
I am currently on step 2: the research step, and step 3: the brainstorming step. I am looking at the different new technology for health and fitness. There is a lot more technology I probably dont know about, that I still need to research. It may be a while before I reach step 4.

### Skills

One skill I have picked up on is **thinking outside of the box.** Doing this allowed me to see more of things in the health and fitness topic that I thought were normal as technology. Technology has a wide scope, So it can be hard to define sometimes.

Another skill I have continued learning is **Researching skills.** Havig to look up lots of technology has been great for learning how to research more, and use the information I get from research in everyday life.

## Conclusion

I was able to find out new technology, and what is defined as technology. And there is still so much more to learn.
